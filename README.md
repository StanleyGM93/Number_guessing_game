# [Number guessing game](https://stanleygm93.github.io/Number_guessing_game/)

## Purpose
The project was assigned as part of the [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) curriculum. The goal was to add functionality to the webpage so that the game worked as intended. The only file that needed to be altered was the `script.js` file. To complete the added task of having an alert I altered the `game.js` file as it made the most sense. 

## Setup
1. Download the files from [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com)
1. Initialise a local git repository `git init`
1. Commit these files to the git repository `git commit -m ""`
1. Added a README file
